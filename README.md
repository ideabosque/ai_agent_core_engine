### 🧠 **Stateless Multi-LLM AI Agent Core Engine — Architecture Overview**
![AI Agent Core Engine Architecture Diagram](/images/ai_agent_core_engine_architecture.jpg)

This diagram showcases a **serverless, multi-LLM AI agent orchestration system** powered by **SilvaEngine**. It supports **real-time interactions over WebSocket**, integrates **multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude)**, and executes tasks using **asynchronous Lambda functions and modular handlers**.

---

#### 🔄 **End-to-End Flow Description (Updated)**

##### 1. **User Interaction (WebSocket Query)**

* The **User** initiates a query via **WebSocket (WSS)**.
* The query is routed through **Amazon API Gateway**, acting as a real-time interface for bidirectional communication.

##### 2. **Initial Message Routing**

* API Gateway forwards the request to an **AWS Lambda** (`SilvaEngine Area Resource`) for validation, routing logic, and enqueueing.
* The message is pushed to **Amazon SQS** (`SilvaEngineTask Queue`) for asynchronous, decoupled task execution.

##### 3. **Agent Task Execution (Async)**

* **SilvaEngine Agent Task**, another Lambda function, dequeues the message and invokes:

  * Tool calling logic.
  * AI agent orchestration.
  * External function integrations.

##### 4. **AI Agent Core Orchestration**

* The **AI Agent Core Engine** acts as the **stateless orchestrator**. Responsibilities include:

  * Managing **conversation context** using **Amazon DynamoDB**.
  * Delegating the query to the appropriate **LLM Agent Handler** based on routing rules or model availability.

##### 5. **Multi-LLM Routing via Agent Handlers**

* The platform supports multiple language models via **dedicated handlers**:

  * **OpenAI Agent Handler** → routes to **OpenAI Response API**
  * **Gemini Agent Handler** → routes to **Google Gemini API**
  * **Anthropic Agent Handler** → routes to **Anthropic Claude API**

Each handler formats, sends, and processes responses independently, enabling **model-agnostic orchestration**.

##### 6. **Final AI Response Handling**

* The **AI Agent Handler** (green box) handles:

  * Response post-processing.
  * Tool call updates.
  * State updates and results formatting.
  * Sends **WebSocket replies** to the user via the original API Gateway connection.

| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **True Multi-LLM Support** | Unified engine dynamically selects and communicates with OpenAI, Gemini, or Claude. |
| **Modular Handler Layer**  | Handlers for each model can be independently managed, scaled, or extended.          |
| **Extensible Backend**     | Easily add future models or vendors by plugging in new handler modules.             |

---

#### 📤 **6. Final Delivery via WebSocket**

* Once the task is completed and results are ready:

  * The system asynchronously triggers **Send Data to WebSocket**.
  * The **user receives the final response** through the established WSS connection.

## ⚙️**Deployment and Setup**

To successfully deploy and configure the AI Agent, please follow the detailed instructions provided in the [AI Agent Deployment Guide](https://github.com/ideabosque/ai_agent_deployment). This resource includes step-by-step guidance to ensure a smooth and efficient setup process.

## 🤖 **Agent Definition & Configuration (Event Handler Layer)**
![AI Agent Event Handler Class Diagram](/images/ai_agent_event_handler_class_diagram.jpg)

This section defines the architecture for how agents are implemented, extended, and executed using a modular, class-based event handling system. It enables **runtime polymorphism** across different language model providers such as OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, and Ollama.

---

### 🧩 **1. Base Class: `AIAgentEventHandler`**

The [`AIAgentEventHandler`](https://github.com/ideabosque/ai_agent_handler) serves as the **abstract base class** for all model-specific agent handlers. It defines the common interface and shared utilities required to run an agent against a target LLM.

#### **Core Attributes**

* `endpoint_id`: Identifier for the active agent.
* `agent_name`, `agent_description`: Metadata for logging and auditing.
* `short_term_memory`: Runtime memory or summarization store.
* `settings_dict`: Loaded model configuration.
* `accumulated_json`: Structured context/data accumulated across turns.

#### **Key Methods**

* `invoke_async_func(...)`: Dynamically invokes a registered Python function.
* `send_data_to_stream(...)`: Streams output back to the user in real time.
* `get_function(...)`: Retrieve and load the target function to enable dynamic invocation during runtime, ensuring it's prepared and ready for execution as part of the function-calling workflow.
* `accumulate_partial_json(...)`: Handlers for structured data processing.

---

### 🧠 **2. Model-Specific Agent Handlers**

Each subclass provides a concrete implementation of `invoke_model()` for the designated provider.

---

#### ✅ **`OpenAIEventHandler`**

* **Client:** `openai.OpenAI`

## 🧪 Testing and Prototype

This script provides a unified test harness for validating AI agent orchestration in both:

1. **Local Function Invocation Mode** (`test_run_chatbot_loop_local`)
   - Runs against local GraphQL endpoint and lambda-mimicking functions.
   - Validates internal integration between `askModel`, `asyncTask`, and the core orchestration engine.
   - Useful for debugging logic, schema mapping, and tool execution in development environments.

2. **External Request Mode** (`test_run_chatbot_loop_by_request`)
   - Interacts with deployed GraphQL API via HTTP requests.
   - Emulates real user interactions through RESTful communication.
   - Ideal for testing deployment correctness and system-wide flow.

🔧 **Environment Variables Required**:
- `base_dir`, `agent_uuid`, `user_id`
- AWS credentials: `region_name`, `aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key`
- API test setup: `api_url`, `api_key`, `endpoint_id`

🧩 **Key Integrations**:
- SilvaEngine GraphQL schema loader (`Utility.fetch_graphql_schema`)
- AIAgentCoreEngine task dispatcher and resolver
- Support for multiple LLM backends (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Ollama) via handler system
