### üß† **Stateless Multi-LLM AI Agent Core Engine ‚Äî Architecture Overview**
![AI Agent Core Engine Architecture Diagram](/images/ai_agent_core_engine_architecture.jpg)

This diagram showcases a **serverless, multi-LLM AI agent orchestration system** powered by **SilvaEngine**. It supports **real-time interactions over WebSocket**, integrates **multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude)**, and executes tasks using **asynchronous Lambda functions and modular handlers**.

---

#### üîÑ **End-to-End Flow Description (Updated)**

##### 1. **User Interaction (WebSocket Query)**

* The **User** initiates a query via **WebSocket (WSS)**.
* The query is routed through **Amazon API Gateway**, acting as a real-time interface for bidirectional communication.

##### 2. **Initial Message Routing**

* API Gateway forwards the request to an **AWS Lambda** (`SilvaEngine Area Resource`) for validation, routing logic, and enqueueing.
* The message is pushed to **Amazon SQS** (`SilvaEngineTask Queue`) for asynchronous, decoupled task execution.

##### 3. **Agent Task Execution (Async)**

* **SilvaEngine Agent Task**, another Lambda function, dequeues the message and invokes:

  * Tool calling logic.
  * AI agent orchestration.
  * External function integrations.

##### 4. **AI Agent Core Orchestration**

* The **AI Agent Core Engine** acts as the **stateless orchestrator**. Responsibilities include:

  * Managing **conversation context** using **Amazon DynamoDB**.
  * Delegating the query to the appropriate **LLM Agent Handler** based on routing rules or model availability.

##### 5. **Multi-LLM Routing via Agent Handlers**

* The platform supports multiple language models via **dedicated handlers**:

  * **OpenAI Agent Handler** ‚Üí routes to **OpenAI Response API**
  * **Gemini Agent Handler** ‚Üí routes to **Google Gemini API**
  * **Anthropic Agent Handler** ‚Üí routes to **Anthropic Claude API**

Each handler formats, sends, and processes responses independently, enabling **model-agnostic orchestration**.

##### 6. **Final AI Response Handling**

* The **AI Agent Handler** (green box) handles:

  * Response post-processing.
  * Tool call updates.
  * State updates and results formatting.
  * Sends **WebSocket replies** to the user via the original API Gateway connection.
