### 🌍 Stateless. Scalable. Multi-LLM.

# **The Next Evolution in AI Agent Orchestration (AI Agent Core Engine)**

Run and scale intelligent agents across **multiple LLMs** — without managing state or sessions.
Built on the **SilvaEngine serverless framework**, our platform delivers **rolling context memory**, modular **function calling**, and real-time **conversation monitoring** — all in one unified, AI-native control plane.

**⚡ Stateless by design** – infinite scale, instant recovery

**🧠 Model-agnostic** – OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and more

**🔌 Modular architecture** – plug-and-play function routing

**📈 Fully observable** – every conversation, recorded and traceable

## **Introduction**

🌐 **The World’s First Stateless Multi-LLM Agent Orchestration Platform**

Welcome to the future of AI agent infrastructure — a revolutionary platform that redefines how intelligent agents are deployed, scaled, and orchestrated across diverse LLM ecosystems. Powered by the **SilvaEngine serverless framework**, this stateless platform offers unmatched agility, reliability, and speed in handling AI-driven conversations at scale.

🔁 **Stateless by Design. Context-Rich by Architecture.**
Say goodbye to complex session management. Our platform enables **rolling context memory**, ensuring every conversation retains critical relevance — without the weight of persistent storage. This lets you scale infinitely, recover instantly, and run lightweight AI agents that remain deeply aware and responsive.

🧠 **Multi-Model Intelligence. Modular Functionality.**
Orchestrate and switch between top-tier LLMs — OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Cohere, and more — in real time. Our modular function-calling engine enables **plug-and-play capabilities**, allowing agents to invoke domain-specific tools and workflows, no matter which model powers the response.

🔍 **Thread-Aware Monitoring & Observability**
Every conversation is **recorded, versioned, and monitored**, giving your teams full visibility into interaction history, decision logic, and user intent. Gain insights, audit compliance, and optimize performance with intelligent observability built into the core.

🧩 **Built for Builders. Trusted by Enterprises.**
Whether you're launching autonomous agents, enhancing customer service, or powering next-gen copilots, this platform equips you with the **flexibility of serverless**, the **power of orchestration**, and the **precision of stateless memory** — all in one unified, AI-native control plane.

🔐 **Secure. Scalable. Future-Proof.**
Designed to meet the needs of mission-critical applications, our platform embraces security-first principles, auto-scaling infrastructure, and modular integration to support evolving enterprise demands in AI deployment.
