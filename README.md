### üß† **Stateless Multi-LLM AI Agent Core Engine ‚Äî Architecture Overview**
![AI Agent Core Engine Architecture Diagram](/images/ai_agent_core_engine_architecture.jpg)

This diagram illustrates a **serverless, stateless, and modular AI orchestration architecture** built on AWS, powered by **SilvaEngine** and capable of handling **real-time WebSocket-based user interactions** with **multi-LLM agent routing and execution**.

---

#### üîÑ **End-to-End Flow Description**

##### 1. **User Interaction (WebSocket Connection)**

* A **user** sends a query via **WebSocket (WSS)**.
* The message is routed through **Amazon API Gateway**, which acts as the real-time entry point for WebSocket messages.

##### 2. **Request Routing and Task Queueing**

* The **API Gateway** forwards the incoming WebSocket message to an **AWS Lambda function** (`SilvaEngine Area Resource`).
* This Lambda function handles **initial routing and validation**, then pushes the task to **Amazon SQS** (`SilvaEngineTask Queue`) for asynchronous processing.

##### 3. **Agent Invocation via Lambda (Async Pattern)**

* Messages in the task queue are picked up by another **Lambda function** (`SilvaEngine Agent Task`), which:

  * Performs **async tool calling**, **agent model invocation**, or **task execution**.
  * Communicates with the **AI Agent Core Engine** to coordinate model interactions.

##### 4. **Core Agent Logic (Stateless AI Orchestration)**

* The **AI Agent Core Engine**:

  * Acts as the orchestrator of the stateless AI agent workflow.
  * Retrieves context from **Amazon DynamoDB** (used for rolling memory).
  * Sends the user's request to the appropriate **(LLM) Agent Handler**, based on model compatibility or routing logic.

##### 5. **Model-Specific Handler (e.g., OpenAI)**

* The **OpenAI Agent Handler**:

  * Manages the request formatting and token control.
  * Sends the query to the **OpenAI Response API**.
  * Upon receiving the response, returns it to the **AI Agent Core Engine**.

##### 6. **Final Response Handling**

* The **AI Agent Handler** (green box) performs:

  * **Final formatting**, **tool call updates**, or **agent behavior post-processing**.
  * Initiates **async WebSocket responses** to send data back to the user via API Gateway.

| Component                       | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Amazon API Gateway**          | Manages WebSocket communication with users in real time.                   |
| **SilvaEngine Area Resource**   | Lambda handler for routing and preprocessing incoming WebSocket messages.  |
| **SilvaEngineTask Queue (SQS)** | Queues tasks to decouple WebSocket events from processing logic.           |
| **SilvaEngine Agent Task**      | Lambda that executes async tasks like tool calls or agent actions.         |
| **AI Agent Core Engine**        | Stateless core orchestrator that controls context, logic, and LLM routing. |
| **Amazon DynamoDB**             | Stores **rolling memory context** and metadata for agents.                 |
| **OpenAI Agent Handler**        | Dedicated LLM wrapper to send/receive data from OpenAI API.                |
| **AI Agent Handler**            | Handles the last mile ‚Äî updates context, logs, or sends final responses.   |

---

#### üîÅ **Asynchronous & Modular Execution**

* All Lambda functions are **asynchronously invoked**, enabling **scalable execution without session locking**.
* Tool calling, result updates, and responses are **decoupled and modular**, supporting dynamic task execution, retries, and model switching.
